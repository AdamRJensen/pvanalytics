Quality
=======

Irradiance
----------

The ``check_*_limits_qcrad`` functions use the QCRad algorithm [1]_ to
identify irradiance measurements that are beyond physical limits.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   quality.irradiance.check_ghi_limits_qcrad
   quality.irradiance.check_dhi_limits_qcrad
   quality.irradiance.check_dni_limits_qcrad

All three checks can be combined into a single function call.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   quality.irradiance.check_irradiance_limits_qcrad

Irradiance measurements can also be checked for consistency.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   quality.irradiance.check_irradiance_consistency_qcrad

GHI and POA irradiance can be validated against clearsky values to
eliminate data that is unrealistically high.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   quality.irradiance.clearsky_limits

Gaps
----

Identify gaps in the data.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   quality.gaps.interpolation_diff
   quality.gaps.stale_values_diff

The following functions identify days with incomplete data.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   quality.gaps.completeness_score
   quality.gaps.complete

Many data sets may have leading and trailing periods of days with sporadic or
no data. The following functions can be used to remove those periods.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   quality.gaps.start_stop_dates
   quality.gaps.trim
   quality.gaps.trim_incomplete

Outliers
--------

Functions for detecting outliers.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   quality.outliers.tukey
   quality.outliers.zscore
   quality.outliers.hampel

Time
----

Quality control related to time. This includes things like time-stamp
spacing, time-shifts, and time zone validation.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   quality.time.spacing

Utilities
---------

The :py:mod:`quality.util` module contains general-purpose/utility
functions for building your own quality checks.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   quality.util.check_limits
   quality.util.daily_min

Weather
-------

Quality checks for weather data.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   quality.weather.relative_humidity_limits
   quality.weather.temperature_limits
   quality.weather.wind_limits

Features
========

Functions for detecting features in the data.

Clipping
--------

Functions for identifying inverter clipping

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   features.clipping.levels

Clearsky
--------

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated/

   features.clearsky.reno

Orientation
-----------

The following functions examine power or irradiance data to identify
days when the profile matches the expected profile for a PV system
with a fixed orientation or a single-axis tracker. These functions fit
a polynomial (quadratic for fixed, quartic for tracking) to the data
for each day and determine the orientation based on the goodness of
the fit. Both functions will mark days with substantial variability
(for example, due to cloudiness) as False, but may mark consistently
overcast days as True. This behavior can be controlled through the
`peak_min` parameter to both functions which specifies a minimum power
or irradiance value that must be exceeded for a day to be marked
True. Setting `peak_min` higher will exclude more overcast days.

   features.orientation.fixed_nrel
   features.orientation.tracking_nrel
